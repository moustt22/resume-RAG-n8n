# Session Management (Lovable Frontend)

This project uses session-based isolation to safely support multiple users.

## Session ID Generation
- A unique `session_id` (UUID v4) is generated when the page loads.
- The session_id represents one user session.

## Persistence
- The session_id is stored in browser local storage.
- It persists across page refreshes.
- Each browser session receives a different session_id.

## Request Handling
- The same session_id is attached to every request sent to n8n.
- This includes:
  - Resume PDF uploads
  - User chat questions

## Purpose
The session_id is used by the backend to:
- Create a dedicated vector namespace per user
- Prevent document mixing between users
- Ensure that answers are generated only from the user’s own resume

## Security Notes
- No personal data is stored in the session_id.
- Session isolation is enforced server-side in the vector database.
